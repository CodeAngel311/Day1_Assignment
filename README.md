Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of creating, testing and deploying software while ensuring the software is of a high quality.
It is important to have accurated systems which will operate according to what they are built for, systems failure casn be life threatening.
Imagine if the system of landing airplanes has a bug or defect, it could claim many lives.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages
The development of Software engineering
Advancement of structured programming


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - Collect all the details of what the product owner would like the system to do. This information should include as much detail as possible
Design - From the information you collected plan how you need to code the system and all the tests you will need to run to ensure quality and correctness in terms of the requirements
Implementation - Code the product checking all the details from your design.
Testing - test if the system has been implemented correctly and if the implementation satisfies the user
Deployment - release the product for the use of other people
Maintance - From feedback through the process of using your system, correct any mistakes that were not found during production ancd update where there is a need for updates.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall method is straigth and does not require constant interaction with the user. While the Agile method constantly engages the user, fromn time to time in production user feedback is required. Waterfall only requires feedback in the end and is used for the production of small systems while agile is used for larger systems which may require a few months. Developing a calculator can require Waterfall model while developing a e-hailing system requires Agile model.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The Software developer is required to write the code from the requirements collected. 
The Quality Assurance Engineer checks to see that the developer did the correct job and documents his findings in detail.
The Project manager ensures the smooth operation of the entire project, facilitating communication across the teams.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
To avoid reinventing the wheel everytime we code IDEs were developed, this means that common code segments are created into libraries which can be used to code easier. Visual studio is an IDE. It is important to have the latest increment of the project so that if a bug is introduced in the new versiobn we can revert to the old version and carry on coding fro that point. Github is a VCS.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Interaction with teams. Ensure you put members with the same interests in the same team. 
Tight deadlines, communicate with clients and not accept a schedule that compromises quality


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing each individual piece of code. It is important to ensure that the requirements were well understood by the developer.
Integration testing is testing if the different parts of code work well when interacting each other. There maybe different sections of code which need to work together, this is important so that the transion from one part to the other is easy.
System testing is checking the system  as a whole. It is important to ensure that the system does what it was intended for.
Acceptance testing is testing if the user's needs are meet by the system that has been developed. This is important because there is no use building a system that is hard for users to understand or use. 




Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of creating questions which are concise, clear and specific for AI systems, this ensures that thed AI gives you an answer which is revelant to what you need. It is important as it further developes the system to communicate better.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: "Give me baby names"
Improved prompt: "Gives me names suitable for a girl from the bible".
It is more effective because it specifies where the system can start with looking for the name and the gender of the baby.
